        <h1 class="about-heading"> RONNIE SAMSON </h1>
        <p class="about-intro"> I was born on the 30th of November 2004 in General Mariano Alvarez, Cavite. <br>
                                I spent my pre-school to junior high school in Bacoor, Cavite at Mizpah <br>
                                Community Christian Academe. I was a consistent top student since my <br>
                                pre-school days. After I finished my junior high school, I transferred to <br>
                                St. Dominic College of Asia and took the ICT strand to focus and learn more <br>
                                about the computer and specially, programming. <br> <br>

                                I am now living in America with my parents. I'm currently working every morning <br>
                                to evening and after my shift I will go straight to my online classes. You may <br>
                                wonder why I am working. Well, I just want to save for myself in the future and <br>
                                also, I can use my own money to buy some things I want for myself. 
                                </p>
